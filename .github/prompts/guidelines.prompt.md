# GUIDELINES FOR CLEAN CODE
# 1. Naming Conventions
#    - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
#    - Use camelCase for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.
#    - Avoid abbreviations and single-letter names.
# 2. Code Structure
#    - Organize code into functions and classes to promote reusability and readability.
#    - Keep functions and classes small and focused on a single task.
#    - Use consistent indentation and spacing to improve readability.
# 3. Comments and Documentation
#    - Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or decisions.
#    - Use docstrings to document functions and classes, including parameters and return values.
#    - Avoid redundant comments that restate the code.
# 4. Error Handling
#    - Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
#    - Provide meaningful error messages to help with debugging.
#    - Avoid using bare except clauses; specify the exception type.
